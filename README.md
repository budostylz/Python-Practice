```python
# Write an expression that calculates the average of 23, 32 and 64
# Place the expression in this print statement
print((23 + 32 + 64) / 3)
# 39.666666666666664

# Fill this in with an expression that calculates how many tiles are needed.
print( (9*7) + (5*7) )
#print('Total number of tiles in package ', 6 * 17)


# Fill this in with an expression that calculates how many tiles will be left over.
print( (6 * 17) - ( (9*7) + (5*7)) )
